        <h3>2.1 Past Performance</h3>
        <p><strong>Past performance is not indicative of future results.</strong> Historical returns, whether actual or hypothetical, do not guarantee future investment performance. Market conditions change, and what worked in the past may not work in the future.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Projections and Estimates</h3>
        <p>Any projections, forecasts, or estimates provided by our calculators are <strong>hypothetical in nature</strong> and based on assumptions that may or may not be accurate. Actual results may vary significantly from these projections.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Market Risk</h3>
        <p>All investments carry risk, including the potential loss of principal. Stock markets can be volatile, and the value of investments can fluctuate significantly in the short term.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Individual Circumstances</h3>
        <p>Every individual's financial situation is unique. What may be suitable for one person may not be appropriate for another. Consider your:</p>
